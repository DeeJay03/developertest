## Developer Test

This is the Standard Full Stack test using dummy data (from the link provided below) as still waiting for the activation of my api key from rotten tomatoes. I have created the web page as separate files (index.php), but also combined it into a single file (MovieSearch.php). Once the api key has been activated, I will update it accordingly.
